# Gestures-Project

##Zombie Myo Game

###John Lavin

##Purpose of the Application

The purpose of this project was to explore Gesture-Based UI. 
The technology I chose to use was the Myo Armband, designed by Thalmic Labs. 
I designed a game where zombies are spawned on screen and you have to shoot them 
before they attack you or get past you and attack the village. 
The Myo armband is used to control your aim and to fire shoots as well. 

##Gestures Identified

The Myo armband responds to a variety of gestures you make with your hand. Gestures include: Fingers spread, wave right, wave left, fist, rotate, double tap.

The aiming in the game is controlled by the Myoâ€™s panning gesture. 
When the game starts you press the r-key on the keyboard. This centres the screen and allows you to get your arm in the correct position. You can re-centre the screen as often as you like throughout the game. This allows you to rest your arm inbetween waves of zombies. I thought about changing this function to a Myo gesture but I found it too tiring for your arm.

To take aim at an enemy zombie you simply move your arm in the direction of the zombie.

To shoot at the zombie you have three options:

1.	Make a fist.

2.	Wave left.

3.	Wave right.


At first I only had the make fist option but I found that option very tiring. So I decided to incorporate the wave-left and wave-right gestures. I found that when you were aiming to the left of the screen ( pointing your arm to the left of the screen) the most natural/easiest gesture to create was the wave-left gesture. The same applied to aiming to the right of the screen.
