# Gestures-Project

##Zombie Myo Game

###John Lavin

##Purpose of the Application

The purpose of this project was to explore Gesture-Based UI. 
The technology I chose to use was the Myo Armband, designed by Thalmic Labs. 
I designed a game where zombies are spawned on screen and you have to shoot them 
before they attack you or get past you and attack the village. 
The Myo armband is used to control your aim and to fire shoots as well. 

##Gestures Identified

The Myo armband responds to a variety of gestures you make with your hand. Gestures include: Fingers spread, wave right, wave left, fist, rotate.
